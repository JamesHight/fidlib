Fidlib and Firun

execution library, and 'firun', a tool for running fidlib filters from
the command-line.

To use 'fidlib' (one way at least):

  Copy fidlib.h, fidlib.c, fidmkf.h and fidrf_cmdlist.h to your
    project directory
  Build fidlib.c as part of your project
  #include "fidlib.h" in your source for prototypes and structures
  See fidlib.txt for full docs and API
  See also fidlib.c and fidlib.h for additional notes

To use 'firun':

  Type "firun" or "./firun" for an overview
  See firun.txt for full docs, and fidlib.txt for filter types
  
To build 'firun' (if included executables don't work):

  On Linux, run 'mk-firun' to build it
  On Windows, try 'mk-firun-mingw' using the MinGW MSYS environment
